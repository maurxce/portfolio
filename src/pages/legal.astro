    <h5>Liability for Content</h5>

    <p>
      The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care.
      However, we cannot guarantee the contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality.
      According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz - German Telemedia Act),
      we as service providers are liable for our content on these pages by general laws.
      However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service providers are not obliged to
      monitor external information transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to
      illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws
      remain unaffected. However, a liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of
      knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove
      the content immediately.

    <h5>Liability for Links</h5>

    <p>
      Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control.
      Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for these external contents. The respective
      provider or operator of the websites is always responsible for the contents of the linked
      pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
      Illegal contents were not identified at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring
      of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation.
      Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.

      The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright
      require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are
      only permitted for private, non-commercial use. In so far as the contents on this site were not created
      by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is
      marked as such. Should you become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon
      notification of violations, we will remove such contents immediately.
